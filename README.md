# BlackJack
## A game of chance
In blackjack, your goal is to reach card total of 21 and beat the dealer's hand.
You're each dealt two cards and you are able to "hit" for another card to increase your total, but be careful if your total goes over 21 you will "bust" and your bet will be lost.
On the excellent occasion you're dealt an Ace and either a 10, King, Queen, or Jack with your first two cards - Congratulations you've got a BlackJack and an automatic win!
The dealer's goal is to beat your hand but once they get 17 they will no longer take any more cards.
Keep that in mind when planning your strategies.

The card images were provided from a CSS resource file within this course and came with specialized CSS to render the images.

### Let's play Black Jack
https://tlmcbee.github.io/BlackJack/

Upon loading the page your wallet will have $20. Bet any amount you would wish then click deal. You can hit and stay if you like your hand then the dealer will play and a winner will be determined. From there click "New Deal" the next hand will be played. When your all out of money click "Reset" to start all over.

### Future Plans
In the future I plan on doing the following:
- Creating a function that accounts for Ace's and changes there value to 1 or 11
- Disabling the betting buttons when wallet reaches $0
